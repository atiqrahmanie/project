*Problems*

*Airport, which operates under the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA), currently uses a manual boarding process. 
Passengers must go to the check-in counter, wait in line for their turn, and receive a paper boarding pass from an airline staff member. This system causes:
Long waiting times,Passenger frustration,Delays in boarding,Human errors in verification,Poor use of technology and data.

Project Scope 

This project aims to upgrade the manual boarding process at Airport to a Smart Boarding Pass system, supported by the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA).
The goal is to make the boarding process faster, safer, and more efficient.
