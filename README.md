**Problem Statement
*Faisalabad International Airport, which operates under the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA), currently uses a manual boarding process. Passengers must go to the check-in counter, wait in line for their turn, and receive a paper boarding pass from an airline staff member. This traditional system causes:
Long waiting times
Passenger frustration
Delays in boarding
Human errors in verification
Poor use of technology and data
As more passengers travel by air, this outdated process is no longer efficient or convenient. There is no smart boarding system installed at Faisalabad Airport yet. Therefore, there is a need to upgrade the current system to a smart, digital boarding system that improves speed,  and accuracy.
